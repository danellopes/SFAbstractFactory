### Example of the Abstract Factory

This example of the faceted builder design pattern was develop using Salesforce Apex language, but I've originally learned about this pattern in C#, so a few things changed, mainly the methods and syntax available.

This method provides us with the capacity to enhance system flexibility by constructing factories that yield interfaces, not concrete classes. In the event that our factory must return a different concrete factory, we simply construct a new concrete class that implements the factory interface. This is accomplished by injecting it using the designated method, ensuring seamless operation.
